Remarks in the IESG ballot

which were *not* addressed:

Alissa Cooper:

Enum is dead.

Depends. Anyway, "of interest" was relative to the secondary and
tertiary requests not to other sources of information.

[I-D.ietf-dnsop-dns-terminology] seems sufficient

It's a good text, well written, and right to the point. I have no
better reference.

> The same issue may come up wrt some of the other references.

See issue #7 <https://github.com/bortzmeyer/my-IETF-work/issues/7> I
was not able to find better references. (Personal rant: I prefer URLs
of personal Web pages, that I can find and read immediately, rather
than reference to a scientific symposium hold ten years ago and whose
speeches are not available publically.)
