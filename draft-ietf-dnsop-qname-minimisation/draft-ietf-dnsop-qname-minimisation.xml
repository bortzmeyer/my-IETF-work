<abstract>
<t>This document describes one of the techniques that could be used to
improve DNS privacy (see <xref
target="I-D.ietf-dprive-problem-statement"/>), a technique called "qname
minimisation".</t>
<t>REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION Discussions of the document should take place on the
DNSOP working group mailing list <xref target="dnsop"/>.</t>
</abstract>
</front>

<section title="Introduction and background">
<t>The problem statement is exposed in <xref
target="I-D.ietf-dprive-problem-statement"/> TODO: add a reference to the specific section when ietf-dprive-problem-statement will be published as RFC. The terminology ("qname",
"resolver", etc)
is also defined in this companion document. This specific solution is not intended to fully solve the DNS privacy problem;
instead, it should be viewed as one tool amongst many.</t>
<t>It follows the principle explained in section 6.1 of <xref
target="RFC6973"/>: the less data you send out, the fewer privacy
problems you'll get.</t>
</section>

<section title="Qname minimisation">
<t>The idea is to minimise the amount of data sent
from the DNS resolver. Under current practice, when a resolver receives the query "What is the
AAAA record for www.example.com?", it sends to the root (assuming a
cold resolver, whose cache is empty) the very same question. Sending
"What are the NS records for .com?" would be sufficient (since
it will be the answer from the root anyway). This is compatible with the current DNS system and therefore can
easily be deployed; since it is a unilateral change to the resolver, it
does not change the protocol. Because of that, resolver implementers may do qname minmisation in slightly different
ways.</t>
<t>To do such minimisation, the resolver needs to know the zone cut <xref
target="RFC2181"/>.  Zone cuts do not necessarily exist at every label
boundary.
If we take the name www.foo.bar.example, it is possible that
there is a zone cut between "foo" and "bar" but not between "bar" and
"example"<!-- Real examples today are www.economie.gouv.fr or
www.janet.ac.uk -->. 
So, assuming the resolver already knows
the name servers of .example, when it receives the query "What is the
AAAA record of www.foo.bar.example", it does not always know whether the
request should be sent to the name servers of bar.example or to those
of example. <xref
target="RFC2181"/> suggests a method to find the zone cut (section 6), so
resolvers may try it.</t>
<t>Note that DNSSEC-validating resolvers already have access to this information, since they
have to find the zone cut (the DNSKEY record set is just below, the DS
record set just above).</t>
<t>One should note that the behaviour suggested here
(minimising the amount of data sent in qnames from the resolver) is NOT forbidden by the <xref
target="RFC1034"/> (section 5.3.3) or <xref target="RFC1035"/>
(section 7.2). Sending the full qname to the authoritative name server
is a tradition, not a protocol requirement. This tradition comes<xref target="mockapetris-history"/> from a desire to
optimize the number of requests, when the same name server is
authoritative for many zones in a given name (something which was more
common in the old days, where the same name servers served .com and
the root) or when the same name server is both recursive and authoritative (something which is strongly discouraged now). Whatever the merits of this choice at this time, the DNS is quite
different now.</t>
<t>It may be noticed that many documents explaining the DNS and
intended for a wide audience, incorrectly describe the resolution
process as using qname minimisation, for instance by showing a request
going to the root, with just the TLD in the query. As a result, these
documents may confuse the privacy analysis of the users who see them.</t>
<t>As mentioned before, there are several ways to implement qname minimisation. Two main strategies are
the aggressive one and the lazy one. In the aggressive one, the
resolver only sends NS queries as long as it does not know the zone
cuts. This is the safest, from a privacy point of view. The lazy way
"piggybacks" on the traditional resolution code. It sends traditional
full qnames and learns the zone cuts from the referrals received, then
switches to NS queries asking only for the minimum domain name. This
leaks more data but probably requires fewer changes in the existing resolver codebase.</t>
</section>

<section title="Operational considerations">
<t>The administrators of the forwarders, and of the authoritative name
servers, will get less data, which will reduce the utility of the
statistics they can produce (such as the percentage of the various
qtypes).</t>
<t>DNS administrators are reminded that the data on DNS requests
that they store may have legal consequences, depending on your
jurisdiction (check with your local lawyer).</t>
<t>Some broken name servers do not react properly to qtype=NS
requests. For instance, some authoritative name servers embedded in load balancers reply properly to A queries but send REFUSED to NS queries.
REMOVE THIS SENTENCE BEFORE PUBLICATION: As an example of today, look at www.ratp.fr (not ratp.fr). This behaviour is a gross protocol violation, and there
is no need to stop improving the DNS because of such
brokenness. However, qname minimisation may still work with such
domains since they are only leaf domains (no need to send them NS
requests). Such setup breaks more than just qname minimisation. It breaks
negative answers, since the servers don't return the correct SOA, and
it also breaks anything dependent upon NS and SOA records existing at
the top of the zone. 
</t>
<t>A problem can also appear when a name server does not react
properly to ENT (Empty Non-Terminals). If ent.example.com has no
resource records but foobar.ent.example.com does, then ent.example.com
is an ENT. A query, whatever the qtype, for ent.example.com must
return NODATA (NOERROR / ANSWER: 0). However, some broken name servers
return NXDOMAIN for ENTs. REMOVE THIS SENTENCE BEFORE PUBLICATION: As
an example of today, look at com.akadns.net or www.upenn.edu with its
delegations to Akamai. If a resolver queries only
foobar.ent.example.com, everything will be OK but, if it implements
qname minimisation, it may query ent.example.com and get a
NXDOMAIN. See also section 3 of <xref
target="I-D.vixie-dnsext-resimprove"/> for the other bad consequences
of this brokenness.</t>
<t>Another way to deal with such broken name servers would be to try
with A requests (A being chosen because it is the most common and
hence a qtype which will be always accepted, while a qtype NS may
ruffle the feathers of some middleboxes). Instead of querying name
servers with a query "NS example.com", we could use "A
_.example.com" and see if we get a referral.</t>
<t>Other strange and non-conformant practices may pose a problem: there is a
common DNS anti-pattern 
used by low-end web hosters that also
do DNS hosting that exploits the fact that the DNS protocol (pre-DNSSEC)
allows certain serious misconfigurations, such as parent and child zones
disagreeing on the location of a zone cut.  Basically, they have a
single zone with wildcards for each TLD like:
<figure>
<artwork>
*.example.          60  IN  A   192.0.2.6
</artwork>
</figure>
(It is not known why they don't just wildcard all of "*." and be done with
it.)</t>
<t>This lets them turn up many web hosting customers without having to
configure thousands of individual zones on their nameservers.  They just
tell the prospective customer to point their NS records at the hoster's
nameservers, and the Web hoster doesn't have to provision anything in
order to make the customer's domain resolve. NS queries to the hoster
will therefore do not give the right result, which may endanger qname
minimisation (it will be a problem for DNSSEC, too).
</t>
<t>Qname minimisation can decrease performance in some cases, for
instance for a deep domain name
(like www.host.group.department.example.com where
host.group.department.example.com is hosted on example.com's name
servers). For such a name, a cold resolver will, depending how qname
minimisation is implemented, send more queries. Once the cache is warm, there will
be no difference with a traditional resolver. A possible solution is
to always use the traditional algorithm when the cache is cold and
then to move to qname minimisation. This will decrease the privacy a
bit but will guarantee no degradation of performance.</t>
<t>Another useful optimisation may be, in the spirit of the HAMMER idea <xref target="I-D.wkumari-dnsop-hammer"/> to probe in advance for the introduction of zone
cuts where none previously existed (i.e. confirm their continued absence,
or discover them.)</t>
</section>

<section title="Performance implications">
<t>The main goal of qname minimisation is to improve privacy by
sending less data. However, it may have other advantages. For
instance, if a root name server receives a
query from some resolver for A.CORP followed by B.CORP
followed by C.CORP, the result will be three NXDOMAINs, since .CORP does
not exist in the root zone. Under query name minimisation, the root name servers would hear only one
question (for .CORP itself) to which they could answer NXDOMAIN, thus
opening up a negative caching opportunity in which the full resolver
could know a priori that neither B.CORP or C.CORP could exist. Thus in
this common case the total number of upstream queries under qname
minimisation would be counter-intuitively inferior to the number of
queries under the traditional iteration (as described in the DNS standard).</t>
<t>Qname minimisation may also improve look-up performance for TLD operators. 
For a typical TLD, delegation-only, and with delegations just under the TLD, a 2-label QNAME query is optimal for finding the
delegation owner name.</t>
</section>

<section title="Security considerations">
<t>Qname minimisation's benefits are clear in the case where you want
to decrease exposure to the
authoritative name server. But minimising the amount of data sent also, in part, addresses the
case of a wire sniffer as well the case of privacy invasion by the
servers. (Encryption is of course a better defense against wire
sniffers but, unlike qname minimisation, it changes the protocol and
cannot be deployed unilaterally. Also, the effect of qname
minimisation on wire sniffers depend on whether the sniffer is, on the
DNS path.)</t>
<t>Qname minimisation offers zero protection against the recursive
resolver, which still sees the full request coming from the stub
resolver.</t>
<t>At this stage, this document does not recommend one of the two
qname minimisation approaches (aggressive or lazy) against the other.</t>
<t><cref>TODO Consequences of qname minimisation for phantom domains
(domains deleted on the parent but still served by original name
servers)?</cref></t>
<t>No security consequence (besides privacy improvement) is known at this time.</t>
</section>

<section title="Implementation status - REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION">

<t>This section records the status of known implementations of the
protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of
this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in <xref target="RFC6982"/>. The description of implementations in this section is
intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in
progressing drafts to RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any
individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the
IETF.  Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the
information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors.
This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a
catalog of available implementations or their features.  Readers
are advised to note that other implementations may exist.</t>

<t>According to <xref target="RFC6982"/>, "this will allow reviewers and working
groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the
benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable
experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented
protocols more mature.  It is up to the individual working groups
to use this information as they see fit".</t>

<t>As of today, no production resolver implements qname
minimisation. For Unbound, see <eref
target="https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/bugs-script/show_bug.cgi?id=648">ticket
648</eref> and for PowerDNS <eref target="https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/issues/2311"/>.</t>

<t>The algorithm to find the zone cuts described in <xref target="zonecutalgo"/>
is implemented with qname minimisation in <eref
target="https://github.com/bortzmeyer/my-IETF-work/blob/master/draft-ietf-dnsop-qname-minimisation/zonecut.go">the sample code zonecut.go</eref>. It is also implemented,
for a much longer time, in an option of dig, "dig +trace", but without qname minimisation.</t>

  <!-- source
       http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/dns-privacy/current/msg00035.html -->
<t>Although a validating resolver already has the logic to find the
zone cut, other resolvers may be interested by this algorithm to
follow in order to locate this cut:
<list style="empty">
<t>(0) If the query can be answered from the cache, do so, otherwise iterate
as follows:</t>
<t>(1) Find closest enclosing NS RRset in your cache. The owner of this NS
RRset will be a suffix of the QNAME - the longest suffix of any NS RRset
in the cache. Call this PARENT.</t>
<t>(2) Initialize CHILD to the same as PARENT.</t>
<t>(3) If CHILD is the same as the QNAME, resolve the original query using
PARENT's name servers, and finish.</t>
<t>(4) Otherwise, add a label from the QNAME to the start of CHILD.</t>
<t>(5) If you have a negative cache entry for the NS RRset at CHILD, go back
to step 3.</t>
<t>(6) Query for CHILD IN NS using PARENT's name servers. The response can
be:
<list style="empty">
<t>(6a) A referral. Cache the NS RRset from the authority section and go back
to step 1.</t>
<t>(6b) An authoritative answer. Cache the NS RRset from the answer section
and go back to step 1.</t>
<t>(6c) An NXDOMAIN answer. Return an NXDOMAIN answer in response to the
original query and stop.</t>
<t>(6d) A NOERROR/NODATA answer. Cache this negative answer and go back to
step 3.</t>
